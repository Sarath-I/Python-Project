Entri elevate module 1 python project - Student Management System

This project is a comprehensive Python-based Student Management System designed to help users efficiently manage student records through a console-based interface. It features a secure login system, robust record management capabilities, and reliable data persistence using simple file storage.

Key Highlights:

Secure and Simple Access: Users log in with a predefined username and password, ensuring that only authorized individuals can manage student data.

Comprehensive Record Management: Add, view, update, search, and delete student records with ease. Each record includes essential details like name, roll number, age, department, and marks.

Reliable Data Storage: All records are stored persistently in a CSV file, ensuring that data is saved and accessible even after the program is closed.

User-Friendly and Error-Handled: The system includes clear input validation, helpful error messages, and a straightforward menu system for easy navigation.

Why This Project Stands Out:
This Student Management System is a great demonstration of fundamental Python programming concepts, including modular code design, file handling, and basic security practices
